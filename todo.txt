Consider adding img of "closed" from myUCSC site to index.html site description paragraph

Make sure also texts when "wait" status opens up as well as "open"

Also, follow link to get the full name of the class for continuity

Write JavaScript for add_class.html that will do ajax and get the full name of the class so the form is more interactive, i.e. asking if this is the class you meant with the entire time breakdown and full class title and everything. use jQuery and $.ajax
